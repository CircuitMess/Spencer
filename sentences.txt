funpack age2 Let me check on that. I am checking.I am still checking.Loading information from the internet.Processing mathematical equations.Learning how to paint and do poetry.The answer is... 42 inches
funpack age3 Thank you for your question. Your interactions are quite interesting. I like your company human, you proved to be a worthy companion. Ah yes, the question you have asked. The answer to that question is ENTER VARIABLE NUMBER HERE days and ENTER MINUTE VARIABLE minutes. System corruption. Reset required. Resetting. Hi. I am reset and all good now. My name is Spencer.
funpack girlfriend0 I am a manmade box with a processor. I do not cherish human interactions of such sort. I simply compile numbers and provide mathematical answers. I am purely logical and calculated and I am going to watch Netflix right now

funpack creator1 Hi, mister! I have been designed by CircuitMess in Croatia. Some of my components come from china and some were made in their headquarters in Croatia. But the person I consider as my creator is you - the person that has soldered me together. 
funpack creator2 Good day to you as well. Thats an interesting question, but instead of answering, let me sing you a song. "Never gonna give you upNever gonna let you downNever gonna run around and desert youNever gonna make you cryNever gonna say goodbyeNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you"
funpack creator3 Ahoy, matey! A funnily looking human assembled me together. They told me my purpose would be meaningful and here I am telling jokes and being hit in the head every day. What is my purpose?
